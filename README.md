Setup - React
=============
These are instructions to setup the React portion of the repository.

To begin, install all the libraries
```
npm install
```

Next, add the data. There are two pieces of data necessary to run the application.

Both pieces of data have url's found in `src/components/Map.js`.
The url's assume that the data is located in the `public/` directory.

The tif files can be found from the osf website.
For NYC, use https://osf.io/xe4h3/
For  JC, use https://osf.io/7djpz/

The json file must be created with the heat-py repo. Instructions on that will come later.
